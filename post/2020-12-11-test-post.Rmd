# Python and R
While both Python and R are really useful languages on their own, sometimes they work best together. In computational biology, it may be easier to visualize data through using "reticulate" so that Python and R can communicate with one another. It sounds challenging at first, but it's actually quite straightforward!

##### In the following example, we will be looking at the distribution of earthquakes in Fiji!

```{r}
#assigning dataset to the variable "quakes"
quakes <- quakes
head(quakes)

```
